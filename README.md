# HomBlocks
For the purpose of saving time of prepration of sequence matrix derived from organelle genomes that would be used in phylogeny analysis. I designed a rapid and accurate method for this sequence matrix construction. In this pipeline, the core conserved fragment (usually the conserved coding genes) will be picked out and intergrated into a long sequence of a species. This method will avoid the bothering sequence alignment procedure of every single gene and result in phylogeney informative and high quality data matrix. Usually It just take few hours to construct the HomBlocks matrix among less then 20 organelle genomes instead of few weeks manual work.
